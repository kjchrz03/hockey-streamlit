# Welcome to my Streamlit app

This is my first crack at extracting data via an api and developing an app to track goals scored on an ice hockey heat map.

As of 10/2/2023, the roster data in the goal_tracker.csv is from the 2022-2023 season; it will be replaced once the NHL API updates the team rosters at the start of the official season.
