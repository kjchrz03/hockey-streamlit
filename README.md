# Welcome to my Streamlit app

This is my first crack at extracting data via an API and developing an app to track goals scored on an ice hockey heat map.

## Method
My Python script was written and developed in Jupyter Notebook. It pulls in NHL API data based on the documentation generated by <a href="https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/swagger/openapi.yaml?ref_type=heads"> Drew Hynes</a>.

It runs daily each morning, pulling data from the previous day's games. Data is either appended to a base dataset or replaces an existing file. Players in the drop-down are strictly those who have scored at least one goal this season.

## Roadmap
I have lots of ideas I want to develop for this app. I have a rough roadmap of ideas and elements I want to add to the app. These include:
<ul>
 <li> Home vs Away goal mapping </li>
 <li> Goal heat mapping </li>
 <li> Advanced Stats trackers </li>
 <li> Player report cards </li>
 <li> Award trackers </li>
</ul>
